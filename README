Lua on Parrot
=============

This is the port of the language Lua 5.1 (http://www.lua.org/)
on the Parrot VM (http://www.parrot.org/).

Many external libraries are already included.


    Suffice it to say that Lua is an elegant, easy-to-learn language with
    a mostly procedural syntax, featuring automatic memory management, full
    lexical scoping, closures, iterators, coroutines, proper tail calls,
    and extremely practical data-handling using associative arrays.
